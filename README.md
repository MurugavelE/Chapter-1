# Chapter 1 - Ionic â€“ Powered by AngularJS

## About this chapter

Ionic is one of the most widely used mobile hybrid frameworks. It has more than 17,000 stars and more than 2,700 forks on GitHub at the time of writing this chapter. Ionic is built on top of AngularJS, a super heroic framework for building MVW apps. In this introductory chapter, we will take a look at AngularJS and understand how it powers Ionic. We will take a look at a couple of key AngularJS components, named directives, and services that are widely used when working with Ionic.

In this chapter, I will explain only AngularJS directives and services. For other core AngularJS concepts, refer to the book/video mentioned earlier. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
 * What is separation of concerns?
 * How does AngularJS solve this problem?
 * What are AngularJS built-in directives and custom directives?
 * What are AngularJS services and how do custom services work?
 * How are directives and services leveraged in Ionic?

**Note:** There is no code associated with this chapter.
